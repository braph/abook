-- PASSAGE TO GIT VERSIONING SYSTEM --

0.6.0pre2:
  * The four following configuration options have been deprecated and will
    no longer be accepted by abook:
      * emailpos
      * extra_column
      * extra_alternative
      * extrapos

    They have been replaced with a single more flexible option:
    index_format.

    This option is a string defining the format of a line in the main list.
    It allows displaying of as many fields as desired, with optional
    width limit, as well as an arbitrary number of alternative fields.

0.6.0pre1 (2006-08-30):
  * The 'customfield' command has been obsoleted by a more flexible set
    of commands: 'field' and 'view'.

    Those two commands make it possible to define fields and organize
    them within tabs as you see fit.

    Not using these commands, the look and feel of previous releases
    will mostly be kept the same. Also see the related 'preserve_fields'
    configuration variable.
